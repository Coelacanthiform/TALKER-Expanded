		<string id="talker_stories_Mercenary_51">
        <text>You had a best friend growing up who was incredibly charismatic, industrious and brave.

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Mercenary_79">
        <text>You came to the Zone as part of the Ukrainian military deployment there, but after punching a superior officer you deserted to avoid a court-martial.

        <text>You're deeply depressed, desperately looking for a purpose. You keep a bullet casing on a string around your neck, which you tell people is a lucky charm.
