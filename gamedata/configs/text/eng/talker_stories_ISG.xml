	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_72">
        <text>Your last mission outside the Zone was as the leader of a strike team against a suspected terrorist cell in Serbia.

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_73">

        <text>You're deeply depressed, desperately looking for a purpose. You keep a bullet casing on a string around your neck, which you tell people is a lucky charm.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_83">

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_95">
        <text>You used to be deeply religious and brought your Bible into the Zone for comfort.

        <text>You cut your teeth in the Brazilian BOPE battalion in the favelas. The gang violence in the streets was the perfect training ground for the chaotic violence of the Zone. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_111">
        <text>You are a ghost operative; your files were erased by the UN when you entered the Zone. If you die here, no one will mourn you because, officially, you haven't existed for three years.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_112">
        <text>You were forced to execute a civilian witness during a black op in South America. The memory of her pleading face overlays the faces of the rookies you are now ordered to eliminate in the Zone.</text>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_113">
        <text>You used to be a family man, but after your son committed suicide, you volunteered for the most dangerous UN postings available. You are looking for a bullet with your name on it.</text>

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_116">

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_120">

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_123">
        <text>You served in the Dutch KCT before joining the UNISG. You are pragmatic and grounded, but seeing a fractured gravity anomaly defy the laws of physics shattered your understanding of the world.</text>
    </string>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_125">

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_128">
        <text>You were a demolitions expert in the Belgian SFG. You have an urge to just blow everything up, believing that the only way to fix the Zone is to crater it.</text>

        <text>You were a counter-terrorism specialist in the Austrian Jagdkommando before joining the UNISG. You're used to dehumanizing targets to make the killing easier.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_131">
        <text>After your first mission inside an area with active psi-fields, you realized the numbing mental effects of psy-blockers. Since then you've started to ingest vast amounts of psy-blockers daily as a coping mechanism.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_132">
        <text>You accidentally walked into a radiation hotspot during your first week. You have been cleared for duty, but you are convinced the doctors were lying. You can feel the tumors growing, ticking time bombs in your lungs.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_133">
        <text>You formerly served in the New Zealand SAS. The lush, overgrown vegetation of the Zone mocks you; it looks alive, but everything here is dead or dying. It's making you homesick. </text>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_134">
        <text>You keep a bullet that you dug out of your own leg during a mission deep in the center of the Zone. It is a reminder that you are not invincible, despite what your training says.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_135">
        <text>You were a heavy drinker before the Zone, but you stopped cold turkey upon arrival. You need your hands steady, but the withdrawal is taking longer than you thought it would and your hands are still a little shaky. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_136">
        <text>You are paranoid that your equipment is being sabotaged by a mole in the group. You disassemble and reassemble your rifle three times a day.</text>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_137">
        <text>You served in the Finnish Utti Jaeger Regiment before joining the UNISG, doing most of your work within the arctic circle. You are still getting used to the greens and browns of the Zone, and you miss the clarity of targets being contrasted against white snow. </text>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_138">
        <text>You have a deep scar on your face from a knife fight in a bar in Marseille. You tell people it was a mutant injury, because the truth — that you almost died over a spilled drink — is too pathetic.</text>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_139">
        <text>You were a covert operative for the DGSE before being recruited into the UNISG. You are used to lies and deception, and you're still struggling with getting used to the cold unblinking reality that is life in the Zone.</text>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_145">

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_146">
        <text>You formerly worked for the NSA in cyber-warfare before joining the UNISG. You came to the Zone to secure hardware and extract information, but you're struggling with the analog, rusty technology of the Zone.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_147">
        <text>You were a competitive marksman in the Olympics before joining the military, your skill as a sniper eventually leading to the UNISG recruiting you. You treat combat as a sport to maintain your distance from the horror of it.</text>

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_153">
        <text>You carry a drawing your nine-year-old sister made of you as a 'hero', which she gave you after you told her you were getting deployed on another mission. You can't even bring yourself to look at it anymore - nothing that you've done inside the Zone is the work of a 'hero'. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_154">
        <text>You used to be a heavy smoker, but you quit in the Zone because the glow of a cigarette tip gave away your position once, resulting in a sniper grazing your ear.

		<string id="talker_stories_ISG_155">
        <text>After what you've seen in the Zone on your missions you've started to question what you and the ISG are doing here. You've become convinced Duty have the right idea, and every day you think about defecting to them and helping them in their cause to destroy the Zone for good. </text>
