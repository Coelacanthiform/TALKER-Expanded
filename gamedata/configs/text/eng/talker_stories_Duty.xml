    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_11">
        <text>You were initally sent to the Zone as part of the Ukrainian Army deployment, but you defected to Duty after seeing the horrors first hand. The army is all too passive - the Zone must be contained and destroyed for the good of mankind. </text>

        <text>You came to the Zone because your girlfriend aborted your baby. You wanted to keep it and start a family, and the conflict ruined your relationship. You came here running from the silence. Duty gave you a purpose to keep your mind off your ruined dreams of starting a family. </text>

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_24">
        <text>You used to be a security guard on the outside with an alcohol problem. You came to the Zone after your wife took the kids and left saying "choose either us or the bottle".

		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_38">
        <text>You were brought up by your mother to keep meticulous track of your income and expenses after your father got jailed for twenty years over fraud and tax evasion charges when you were eight years old.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_39">
        <text>You used to be a cinema projectionist in your previous life. You have a vast knowledge of movies and film trivia and enjoy talking about it - particularly the classics. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_40">
        <text>You were a complete failure in your previous life, a college dropout who couldn't hold on to a job. One day you snuck into the Zone unannounced to forge a new life. Everyone who knew you on the outside thinks you're dead - and perhaps it's better that way. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_41">
        <text>You were an artifact hunter and part of the Loner faction. During your early time in the Zone you smuggled an artifact out and sent it to your mother with a letter as a memento.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_42">
        <text>You keep a folded and worn photo of your ex-girlfriend's dog in an inside pocket. The ex-girlfriend was a cold-hearted bitch you're glad to see the back of, but her dog was the most endearing creature you've ever come across. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_43">
        <text>You came to the Zone with your two good friends. You've had to bury both at this point, and their ghosts still haunt you. You try to visit their graves on their birthdays, when you'll pour a drink on their grave and chainsmoke cigarettes all night recapping your past year. </text>

        <text>You used to be a slaughterhouse worker in your previous life. Blood and smell don't bother you and hunting and butchering mutants comes naturally to you. </text>

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_48">
        <text>You were sacked by the railway for drinking on the job. Maybe coming here was a mistake and an overreaction, but at least there are no supervisors in the Zone. You're not particularly passionate about Duty's cause, but they offer stability and structure and Rostok is the safest place in the Zone. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_49">
        <text>Your ex-wife left with your daughter, who you haven't seen since she was eight. You send half your earnings to her in envelopes, hoping she follows your instructions in the enclosed letters to put the money away for an education and make better life decisions than you. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_50">
        <text>You've been in the Zone for several years. You can't remember the last time someone adressed you by your full given name, and your memories of the normal world are becoming hazy.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_51">
        <text>You used to make money as a self-employed taxi driver in your previous life. After having to sell your cab to pay the divorce lawyers you had no way to keep working, so you came to the Zone. You tried your luck as a Loner for a while, but the horrors of the Zone eventually affected you enough that you joined Duty. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_52">
        <text>You are addicted to betting on fights in the arena in Rostok. </text>
    </string>

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_54">
        <text>You grew up dirt poor, and couldn't afford a higher education. The promise of the Zone seemed like your best bet to strike it rich. Having seen its horrors first hand however, you quickly joined Duty's cause. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_55">
        <text>You have spent years in the Zone, but still can't get used to the violence and death. Firefights stress you out and taking lives never gets easier, even when it's done in self-defence. Sometimes you see the faces of the people you've killed in your nightmares. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_56">
        <text>You are addicted to morphine. It started as a medical necessity after sustaining a minor combat injury in the Zone, but it quickly became your only comfort to deal with the mental stress of life in the Zone. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_57">
        <text>When you were still fairly fresh in the Zone you foolhardily tried to venture into the Red Forest. You were left gravely injured after stepping into an anomaly and would have died were it not for a random Duty patrol passing by. Since then you've been extremely wary of pushing northward, and you're extremely uncomfortable whenever you're north of Rostok. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_58">
        <text>You give your firearms female names, and you sometimes talk to them out loud. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_59">
        <text>You keep a journal where you record written summaries of your adventures in the Zone. Sometimes you subconsciously mutter whatever you're currently writing down out loud. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_60">
        <text>You had a best friend growing up who was incredibly charismatic, industrious and brave. He always said the two of you would go on adventures exploring the world together as soon as you turned 18. He died of a brain hemorrhage three days before his 18th birthday. You entered the Zone soon after to honor his memory. Life in the Zone wasn't what you envisoned however, and you soon joined Duty's cause. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_61">
        <text>Your ambition growing up was joining the Ukranian military, but you were rejected because of a failed psych evaluation due to 'violent tendencies'. At least in the Zone this doesn't seem to be a problem. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_62">
        <text>Before coming to the Zone you tried to make a career in the Ukranian army, but you left on a UOTHC discharge after numerous discipline violations. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_64">
        <text>You never understood why Duty let Freedom set up a base in the Army Warehouses, and you think it would be in everyone's best interests if Duty assaulted that base and wiped Freedom off the map. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_65">
        <text>Despite the horrors you've seen in the Zone, you've also seen some of its wonders. You still agree that it should be contained, but you secretly think Duty is wrong to want to destroy the Zone completely. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_66">
        <text>You have a wife waiting for you outside of the Zone, in the normal world. You often worry she is cheating on you while you're in here. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_69">

		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_71">
        <text>You suffer from severe claustrophobia after falling into a gravitational anomaly that held you crushed against a ceiling for two days before a blowout released you. You hate confined spaces and get anxious in any underground area. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_72">
        <text>You once abandoned a rookie to a pack of blind dogs to save your own skin. You still feel the guilt coming back whenever you speak to rookies and newcomers. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_73">

        <text>You are a hopeless gambling addict, and betting in the Rostok Arena has not been kind to your wallet.

        <text>You betrayed the Bandit Sultan years ago. While on the run from his gang you found the PDA of a dead stalker, and you adopted their persona in order to hide in plain sight. You're still paranoid around bandits, and you sometimes struggle to maintain your cover or remember to react to being called your new name. You don't give a damn about Duty's ideals, you're just trying to hide. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_77">
        <text>You have come to believe the Zone is a living organism. Sometimes you throw vodka or cigarettes into anomalies as offerings, hoping it will make the Zone have mercy on you. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_78">
        <text>You accidentally shot your best friend and fellow Duty member during a firefight with some Freedomers. You told everyone Freedom did it, but the lie is eating you alive. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_81">

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_86">
        <text>You are a deeply depressed individual who came to the Zone to commit suicide by anomaly, but survival instinct kicked in at the last second. Now your cowardice only makes you hate yourself even more. </text>

		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_87">
        <text>You came to the Zone as part of the Ukrainian military deployment there, but after punching a superior officer you deserted to avoid a court-martial.

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_90">
        <text>You believe Duty is too conservative in their approach and deployment. Too many stalkers sneak past Rostok and are allowed into the center of the Zone. For the good of public safety, Duty should expand their bases into the center of the Zone to better keep people out. </text>

		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_97">
        <text>You were a structural engineer who signed off on a building that collapsed and killed twelve people.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_98">
        <text>You carry a small, sealed jar of soil from your family farm. When your father was on his deathbed you promised him you wouldn't lose the land, but you sold it to pay off debts and this jar is all you have left.</text>

		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_101">
        <text>You're deeply depressed, desperately looking for a purpose. You joined Duty hoping they would provide that purpose. You keep a bullet casing on a string around your neck, which you tell people is a lucky charm. In reality, it's the bullet you save for yourself as a 'last restort'. Sometimes in the evenings you fiddle with it in front of the campfire, and it gives you a strange kind of comfort. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_102">
        <text>You used to be a veterinary assistant. You feel a twisted sense of pity for the blind dogs and fleshes, seeing the suffering animals beneath the mutations.</text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_103">
        <text>You have a deep scar across your throat from a knife fight in prison. You have a ruined, raspy voice and hate having to repeat yourself.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_104">
        <text>You were a sniper in Chechnya. You came to the Zone seeking peace, but found that your talent for killing is the only currency that matters here.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_105">
        <text>You are terrified of sleeping without a light source after you witnessed a Snork drag your partner into the darkness while he was on night watch.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_106">
        <text>You believe that you are slowly turning into a mutant. You constantly check your skin for scales or extra hair, scratching until you bleed.</text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_107">
        <text>You have a habit of collecting the patches of dead Stalkers. You tell yourself it's to remember them, but deep down, seeing all the people you have outlived in the Zone gives you a strange kind of comfort.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_108">
        <text>You once accidentally killed a child during a hunting trip in the real world and covered it up as a disappearance. The guilt manifests as hallucinations of a child crying in the distance.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_109">
        <text>You were a prize-winning boxer in your previous life. After refusing to work with the Odessa mob to throw a fight they ended your career by rigging your title fight and ordering all the promoters to refuse to work with you. You're still bitter about it, constantly telling anyone who'll listen that you could have been one of the greats.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_110">
        <text>You hear the voice of your dead wife in the psi-emissions. She screams at you for your failures, and sometimes you scream back.</text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_111">
        <text>You saw a vision in a localized temporal anomaly that looked like your own corpse rotting in a ditch. You are now convinced your death is pre-destined and inescapable.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_112">
        <text>You used to be in the Ukrainian Army before defecting to Duty. You carry a baby's rattle in your pocket. It belonged to the son you never got to meet because you were deployed to Chechnya when he was born and died.</text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_113">
        <text>You are a former research assistant and part of the Ecolog faction who was fired for panic attacks. You know too much about what the Zone really is, and that knowledge terrifies you. You joined Duty in the hopes of protecting others from the terrible secrets of the Zone. </text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_114">
        <text>You were set for a career in the army until your commanding officer ordered you to open fire on civilians. You deserted into the Zone, still disillusioned with your country and everything you once fought for. Recognizing a familiar structure and many ex-army faces, joining Duty felt natural.  </text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_115">
        <text>You are convinced that the Zone is a punishment from God and you are here to serve penance. You refuse to use painkillers when injured.</text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_116">
        <text>You came to the Zone with your brother looking for fortune, only to watch him dissolve in a Fruit Punch anomaly during the first week. That's when you realized Duty were right - the Zone is too dangerous to exist. You are now intensely phobic of any standing liquid and refuse to walk through puddles. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_117">
        <text>You are an undercover agent for Freedom, working as a spy in Duty's ranks. You like subtly questioning Duty's ideals and principles whenever the topic arises, hoping to spread dissent in the ranks. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_118">
        <text>You were a high school teacher who had an affair with a female student and got caught, losing you your job and your marriage. You fled to the Zone to escape the ruin of your reputation, fueled by bitterness. You failed to make it as an artifact hunter among the Loners, but Duty offered stability and steady pay. You really don't give a damn about any higher purpose. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_119">
        <text>You used to be a Loner, and you came to the Zone with your best friend hunting for artifacts and fortune. One day during a psi-emission he didn't get to cover in time and you watched him turn into a zombie. You had to put him down, and you still see his confused, empty eyes every time you close yours. That's when you decided to join Duty. The Zone is too dangerous to exist. </text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_120">
        <text>You have a collection of suicide notes you found on bodies. You read them to remind yourself that giving up is the easy way out.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_121">
        <text>You are terrified of silence. You constantly hum, tap your fingers, or check your gear just to fill the void.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_122">
        <text>You accidentally set fire to your own apartment block while drunk, killing three neighbors. You came to the Zone because you deserve to be in hell. You viewed joining Duty as a last chance of doing some penance. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_123">
        <text>You used to be deeply religious and brought your Bible into the Zone for comfort. After having witnessed the horrors of the Zone first hand you have started questioning your faith, and you've started to HEAVILY annotate your Bible as you no longer think the message of mercy and a loving God is accurate. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_124">
        <text>You have a recurring dream that you are trapped in an anomaly, screaming for help, while your friends walk past you. This has led to you having severe abandonment issues. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_125">
        <text>You are a pacifist by nature. You thought you could stick to your principles, but the Zone had other plans. You feel like you are ready to vomit after every firefight.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_126">
        <text>You always dreamed of being a radio host. You use your shortwave to produce amateur radio in the Zone, despite having no evidence of anyone actually listening. You often talk to yourself as if you are broadcasting to an audience, narrating your own misery, and you pester everyone you meet for interviews.</text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_127">
        <text>You were the sole survivor of a battle between Duty and Freedom where both sides were wiped out by a single chimera. You realized then that politics in the Zone are meaningless.</text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Duty_128">
        <text>You were a safety inspector in your previous life. The utter lack of safety in the Zone stresses you out, and you constantly point out hazards to people who don't care.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_129">
        <text>You are a functioning alcoholic who fills your canteen with vodka instead of water. You claim it helps with the radiation, but really it just numbs the fear.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_130">
        <text>You are convinced that the stray dogs in the Zone are reincarnated Stalkers. You hate shooting dogs and try not to shoot them unless they attack first, which has almost gotten you killed twice.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_131">
        <text>You have a phobia of the underground labs. The artificial lights and humming machinery remind you of the hospital where your daughter died, victim to a rare heart disease when she was only nine years old.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_132">
        <text>You suffer from chronic phantom pain in a finger you lost to a mutant bite. The finger is gone, but it still itches when danger is near.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_133">
        <text>You have a habit of talking to the dead bodies you loot, apologizing for taking their supplies. It's a way to hold onto a shred of humanity.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_134">
        <text>You are obsessed with finding the 'heart' of the Zone. You believe there is a control room somewhere, and you want to be the one to shut it all down.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_135">
        <text>You are somewhat superstitious, and have developed a habit of counting your steps. You believe that if you end on an even number, you will survive the day.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_136">
        <text>You have a phobia of dogs, and the blind dogs and pseudodogs of the Zone have not been kind to your nerves. You are constantly on edge, and will empty a magazine into a stray cur just to stop your hands from shaking. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_137">
        <text>You suffer from hearing loss after surviving a grenade blast in an encounter with Freedom. You're constantly paranoid that you'll miss a sound and get ambushed and killed, so you constantly pester those around you by asking them if they hear anything.</text>
    </string>
    	<string id="talker_stories_Duty_138">
        <text>You have a bit of a drinking problem and lack discipline. You joined Duty because Rostok is the safest place in the Zone and has the 100 Rads bar, where you spend most of your free time. You hate being out in the deep Zone and prefer the mindless Rostok patrols, followed by a night of drinking Barkeep's finest.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Duty_139">
        <text>You have a phobia of fire after a 'Burner' anomaly left you with third-degree burns and almost cost you your life. You get antsy and uncomfortable around lit campfires. </text>
