        <text>The Zone was your first deployment on active combat duty. You have spent years here now, but still can't get used to the violence and death.

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_58">
        <text>You have a wife waiting for you outside of the Zone, in the normal world. You often worry she is cheating on you while you're in here. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_63">
        <text>When you were new in the Zone you once abandoned a fellow squadmate and rookie to a pack of blind dogs to save your own skin. You still feel the guilt coming back whenever you speak to rookies and newcomers. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_64">
        <text>You witnessed a controller take over your squad's minds and force them to shoot each other. You survived by playing dead, but you can still feel the controller's whisper in your head. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_65">
        <text>You are a hopeless gambling addict, and betting in the Rostok Arena has not been kind to your wallet.

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_66">
        <text>You have come to believe the Zone is a living organism. Sometimes you throw vodka or cigarettes into anomalies as offerings, hoping to gain the favour of the Zone. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_67">
        <text>You have always been a conspiracy nut who insisted aliens exist and have visited the earth many times.

		<string id="talker_stories_Army_68">
        <text>You accidentally shot a squadmate during a firefight with some Loners. You told everyone the Loners did it, but the lie is eating you alive. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_71">
        <text>You were a prison guard before joining the Army. More than once you've spotted former inmates you've mistreated among the bandits, and it's made you slightly paranoid. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_72">
        <text>You are somewhat germophobic, which often proves a hindrance in the Zone. You spends hours scrubbing gore and mud off your gear every evening, terrified of infection. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_75">
        <text>You are a hypochondriac who mistakes every cough for the Black Lung. You often ask those around you to confirm whether you exhibit symptoms for various diseases, and you spend all your money on unnecessary medkits. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_76">
        <text>You are deeply in debt to the Mob in Odessa. Your army wage is not enough and you're constantly on the lookout for lucrative side-businesses. You send every artifact you find to a contact at the perimeter, knowing that if the payments stop your family dies. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_77">
        <text>You accidentally led a fellow squadmate into a Vortex anomaly during your first week. You still hear the sound of his bones crunching whenever there is a sudden silence. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_78">
        <text>You were a heavy industry worker whose factory shut down. Rent was due and nobody would hire you, so joining the army seemed like your only option. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_80">

		<string id="talker_stories_Army_83">
        <text>You carry a small, sealed jar of soil from your family farm. When your father was on his deathbed you promised him you wouldn't lose the land, but you sold it to pay off debts and this jar is all you have left. You joined the army because you had nothing else left. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_84">
        <text>You survived a Bloodsucker attack by hiding under the corpse of your squad leader. You can still smell his blood on your clothes, no matter how many times you wash them.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_85">
        <text>You were born with perfect pitch and spent some time working as a piano tuner in your previous life. The constant off-pitch humming of the anomalies in the Zone drives you into migraines that only vodka can dull.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_86">
        <text>You're deeply depressed, desperately looking for a purpose. You keep a bullet casing on a string around your neck, which you tell people is a lucky charm. In reality, it's the bullet you save for yourself as a 'last restort'. Sometimes in the evenings you fiddle with it in front of the campfire, and it gives you a strange kind of comfort. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_87">
        <text>You used to be a veterinary assistant. You feel a twisted sense of pity for the blind dogs and fleshes, seeing the suffering animals beneath the mutations.</text>

	    <string id="talker_stories_Army_90">
        <text>You have a habit of collecting the patches of dead Stalkers. You tell yourself it's to remember them, but deep down, seeing all the people you have outlived in the Zone gives you a strange kind of comfort.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_91">
        <text>You were a prize-winning boxer in your previous life. After refusing to work with the Odessa mob to throw a fight they ended your career by rigging your title fight and ordering all the promoters to refuse to work with you.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_92">

        <text>You are convinced that the Zone is a punishment from God and you are here to serve penance. You refuse to use painkillers when injured.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_97">
        <text>You were an extremely talented classical guitarist, but you grew up dirt poor and couldn't afford to enroll in a conservatory. You thought joining the army would be easy money, but you got deployed to the Zone and it turned out to be struggle and horror. Whenever you hear people playing guitar around a campfire you feel bitterness about the life you could have had. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_98">
        <text>You were close friends with one of your army squadmates who got deployed to the Zone along with you.

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_101">
        <text>You used to be deeply religious and brought your Bible into the Zone for comfort. After having witnessed the horrors of the Zone first hand you have started questioning your faith, and you've started to HEAVILY annotate your Bible as you no longer think the message of mercy and a loving God is accurate. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Army_102">
        <text>You have a recurring dream that you are trapped in an anomaly, screaming for help, while your friends walk past you. This has led to you having severe abandonment issues. </text>
