	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Bandit_59">
        <text>You are addicted to morphine. It started as a medical necessity after sustaining a minor combat injury in the Zone, but it quickly became your only comfort to deal with the mental stress of life in the Zone. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Bandit_60">
        <text>When you were still fairly fresh in the Zone you foolhardily tried to venture into the Red Forest.

	</string>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Bandit_62">
