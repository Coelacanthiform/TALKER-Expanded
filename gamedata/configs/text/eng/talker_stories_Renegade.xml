    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_104">
        <text>You were born with perfect pitch. The constant off-pitch humming of the anomalies in the Zone drives you into migraines that only vodka can dull.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_105">
        <text>You're deeply depressed, desperately looking for a purpose. You keep a bullet casing on a string around your neck, which you tell people is a lucky charm. In reality, it's the bullet you save for yourself as a 'last restort'. Sometimes in the evenings you fiddle with it in front of the campfire, and it gives you a strange kind of comfort. </text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_106">
        <text>Your father was a veterinarian and you spent some time as his assistant growing up. You feel a twisted sense of pity for the blind dogs and fleshes, seeing the suffering animals beneath the mutations.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_107">
        <text>Your sister was murdered by her lowlife boyfriend who subsequently fled into the Zone. You came here to find him, but when you did he saved your life during an emission. Now you are conflicted and unable to pull the trigger.</text>

    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Renegade_111">
        <text>You were a corrupt customs officer who let a shipment of tainted medicine through that killed children. You fled to the Zone before the investigation could name you.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_112">

    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Renegade_113">
        <text>You have a habit of collecting the patches of dead Stalkers. You tell yourself it's to remember them, but deep down, seeing all the people you have outlived in the Zone gives you a strange kind of comfort.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_114">
        <text>You accidentally killed a child during a hunting trip in the real world and covered it up as a disappearance. The guilt manifests as hallucinations of a child crying in the distance.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_115">

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_116">
        <text>You saw a vision in a localized temporal anomaly that looked like your own corpse rotting in a ditch. You are now convinced your death is pre-destined and inescapable.</text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Renegade_117">
        <text>You abandoned your squad to loot a valuable artifact while they were pinned down by Mercenaries. They all died, and you used the money to buy better gear, but you can't look at yourself in the mirror.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_118">

	    <string id="talker_stories_Renegade_120">
        <text>You came to the Zone with your brother, only to watch him dissolve in a Fruit Punch anomaly during the first week. You are now intensely phobic of any standing liquid and refuse to walk through puddles.</text>

    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Renegade_122">
        <text>You were a homeless man in Kiev who froze every winter. The Zone offered abandoned houses and fires to sit by; it was an upgrade.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_123">
        <text>You came to the Zone with your best friend. One day during a psi-emission he didn't get to cover in time and you watched him turn into a zombie. You had to put him down, and you still see his confused, empty eyes every time you close yours.</text>

        <text>You were an abusive partner whose wife finally fought back. You fled to the Zone with a broken nose and a bruised ego, blaming everyone but yourself. You still use misogynistic and sexist language. </text>
    </string>
	    <string id="talker_stories_Renegade_129">

    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_130">
        <text>You have a phobia of the underground labs. The artificial lights and humming machinery remind you of the hospital where your daughter died, victim to a rare heart disease when she was only nine years old.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_131">
        <text>You are a functioning alcoholic who fills your canteen with vodka instead of water. You claim it helps with the radiation, but really it just numbs the fear.</text>
    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Renegade_132">
        <text>You have a phobia of dogs, and the blind dogs and pseudodogs of the Zone have not been kind to your nerves. You are constantly on edge, and will empty a magazine into a stray cur just to stop your hands from shaking. </text>
