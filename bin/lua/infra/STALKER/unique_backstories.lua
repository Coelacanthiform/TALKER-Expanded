You've tasked yourself with keeping the stalkers that live in Rookie Village safe from outside threats, and you keep a network of scouts and informants that alert you to any unfriendly movements in the area. Although he is sometimes reluctant, Sidorovich realises that protecting the village is in his best interest and you frequently work with him to assemble raiding parties when required to stamp out bandits, mutants or other threats in the area. You have been around for a long time, rumours say you even helped Strelok out briefly all those years ago. You have a long standing friendship with Fanatic.", -- Wolf

Legends say you were the first stalker to reach the Wish Granter, and you wished for the ability to treat any living creature in the Zone - a wish that was granted while removing your capacity to distinguish between humans and mutants. This legend is false and you have done your best to deny it, but you suspect it may have arisen due to the fact that you're the only known person to have succesfully tamed a pseudodog.", -- Doctor

Formerly just a barkeeper, you came to the Zone because you never found your place in the outside world.

Surprisingly you turned out to have a knack for leadership and managed to restore the faction to a respectable state, although still not yet returned to its full former glory.", -- Cold

Originally a member of the Loner faction, you found yourself trapped in the Great Swamps following the emission that cut the swamps off from the rest of the Zone for a time. With no place to go you took shelter in the Clear Sky camp, joining the faction out of necessity rather than for a cause. After Cold assumed the position of Clear Sky leader, you filled the vacant bartender position he left behind - a role that suits you given you're not particularly committed to the ideals of the faction.", -- Librarian

Unlike most stalkers you are completely apathetic towards artifacts, and simply saw the Zone as a new opportunity to pursue your love of hunting. It's rumoured that you have killed one of each type of mutant in the Zone, and rookies sometimes come to your shop to ask for advice or listen to your stories. You are older middle-aged now and mostly retired from active hunting, instead running a butcher shop in the Train Depot in Garbage. Despite being a trader your love for hunting shines through, and you sell hunting gear for unusually low prices and are willing to pay unusually well for choice cuts of mutant parts and hunting trophies.", -- Butcher

You were formerly assigned to guarding Cordon when you were still a Major, but after the debacle of Operation Fairway you were promoted to Colonel and given leadership of all troops in and around the Zone. The dubious nature of your promotion - rumoured to be the result of cronyism and backroom dealings - sparked great dissent among veteran officers. You dealt with most of them by demoting, discharging or reassigning them to the most dangerous parts of the Zone, and now few dare question your authority. You have always been unscrupulous, and were known to accept bribes in your past as leader of the military checkpoint in Cordon. These days you use your position to subvert official policy in order to trade personal favours with the other factions, enriching yourself in the process.", -- Major Kuznetsov

As one of the few survivors of that disaster you are still troubled by the past as the majority of the other members of the operation were quickly scattered and died to anomalies, were zombified by emissions or worse. You almost died to a Controller, and after being extracted from the Zone you had to spend years in civilian hospitals to recover your mental health. You eventually returned to the Zone out of a sense of duty, hoping to not only heal other's injuries but teach them about the Zone and warn them of its horrors so they don't suffer the same fate he and the rest of Operation Fairway did.

You're in charge of repairs and maintenance of gear, equipment and weapons. You're a long-time friend with the base's medic Rogovets.

Your first run-in with the law came as a young man: after your best friend died of an overdose you found and murdered the dealers, which landed you in prison. You had several other altercations with the law afterward, eventually leading you to pursue your luck in the Zone. You quickly found the Bandit faction and rose among the ranks, assuming leadership after the assassination of your predecessor Borov. You first set up in the Skadovsk - which you planned to take ownership of - but Beard and the Loner faction kicked you out some years back leading you to set up a new base of operations in the factory in the northern part of Dark Valley. Despite that setback nobody in the faction questions your authority, and you have managed to impose a semblance of order on the otherwise unruly Bandit faction.", -- Sultan
	["val_smart_terrain_7_3_bandit_mechanic_stalker"] = "You are a long-serving technician and mechanic for the Bandit faction. You previously worked as a mechanical engineer at a factory, before being fired over a drunken brawl. Your alcoholism eventually led you to losing both your wife and your home too, and with nothing to lose you set out for the Zone. You soon ran into the bandits of Garbage who had a pressing need for a technician, and you've been with the faction ever since.", -- Limpid

You capitalised on the chaos following the assassination of Borov - the former Bandit leader - and quickly entrenched yourself within the new Bandit settlement in Dark Valley.

Although appearing strict by the standards of the Zone you are more moderate than your predecessor Krylov and less cynical than Duty's first leader Tachenko. Your origins are in Spetsnaz, and you were part of the first military expedition into the Zone in 2006. As one of the few survivors of that ill-fated expedition you are determined to prevent the Zone from causing similar harm to others. In the short term you are focused on containing the Zone, but your long-term focus is the search for a way to destroy it for good - probably as a result of a reluctant cooperation with the Ecologists.", -- General Voronin

You came up as a junior lieutenant in the Ukranian army and were part of the first cadre of soldiers to be sent to the Zone in 2006.

You joined Duty to put your skills to use and serve a greater calling after first experiencing personal loss and tragedy in the Zone as a stalker of the Loner faction.", -- Aspirin
	["bar_visitors_stalker_mechanic"] = "You are a technician and former army mechanic. You used to work on car repairs in the outside world before the emergence of the Zone but enlisted with the army in 2011 when you heard they had trouble maintaining their vehicles in the Zone. You would have died if not for the intervention of a Duty patrol, which led you to join them out of gratitude after finishing your tour. Years of fighting wore you down and led you to abusive drinking, though General Voronin personally intervened several times to prevent your dishonorable discharge.

You were rescued by a Duty patrol, and since you had nowhere else to go you joined them.

Back in the day you helped Strelok by devicing the psi-helmet, a countermeasure equipment that allowed him to enter psi-fields. You are particularly interested in the secret labs housed in the Zone, but you also specialise in artifact research and often employ stalkers to find new ones to study.

Under your command Freedom has toned down their conflict with Duty, instead establishing an HQ in the Army Warehouses and concentrating on fighting off the endless Monolith onslaughts coming from the North. While you are mindful of Freedom's ideals, you are somewhat weary and suspicious due to recent problems with traitors selling Freedom's secrets to the Mercenaries.", -- Lukash

You're known for two things: on the one hand you have quick hands and can treat wounds well, on the other you're addicted to drugs and alcohol.

Some time after being freed from the space anomaly by Scar you left the Mercenaries, having grown tired of all the death and killing. You then took up your current position in Freedom.

When the Chernobyl Power Plant exploded you refused to evacuate, chosing instead to stay behind. After the second explosion at the Reactor, you discovered your ability to sense and bypass anomalies. With the help of a Compass artifact, you once escaped a Space Anomaly - something nobody else is known to have been able to do.
