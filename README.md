# TALKER Expanded
A fork of [TALKER](https://github.com/danclave/TALKER). See the main repo for full installation instructions and setup guide.

This is my personal experiment attempting to get more immersion and roleplaying out of the already amazing TALKER mod.

I am an absolute hack, and all credit for this amazing mod goes to the creators and maintainers of the main repo. Credit to [this](https://github.com/danclave/TALKER/issues/39) suggestion for forming the basis of the improved basic rules I'm using in my prompt. Credit to [issue#40](https://github.com/danclave/TALKER/issues/40) of the main repo for the basic code for reloading personalities on existing save games. Credit also to that same user again ([CanineHatTrickOnNose](https://github.com/CanineHatTrickOnNose)) for doing the initial revision of faction personalities and unique character personalities. I used his files as starting point, and some of his characterisations are still in the files wholesale alongside my additions as they fit the character well.

## CHANGES FROM MAIN BUILD

*   **Backstories:** The biggest fundamental change I've made is introducing Backstories. Each character now has a backstory to supplement their personality traits. Unique characters have unique backstories based on lore and information about the character in the game, from previous games and/or on the wiki. Each non-unique NPC is given a random backstory from a list of 100+ depending on the faction.

*  **Immersion:** NPCs with specific roles (traders, technicians, medics, bartenders, guides etc) have their game function mentioned as part of the backstory. This should hopefully make responses be more immersive, such as bartenders offering you a drink and guides acting like guides.

*   **Expanded random NPC character personality:** In addition to revising and expanding the list of personality traits (up to over 130 personality traits from 63), the script has been modified to assign two random traits to every non-unique NPC instead of one. Between backstories and two traits, the hope is that every random NPC will feel unique and distinctive.

*   **Better prompting:** The basic prompt has been greatly expanded, giving the LLM more information and more rules on how to behave. The prompt generator has been revised as well to give more dynamic information: not only backstories but the speaker's rank and faction identity is more clearly defined to the LLM, leading to better output.

## EXISTING SAVES/RELOADING PERSONALITIES AND BACKGROUNDS
If you have an ongoing save, or you want to reset randomly generated personalities or backgrounds you can go to TALKER\bin\lua\domain\repo and in personalites.lua/backstories.lua you can change RESET_PERSONALITIES_ON_LOAD/RESET_BACKSTORIES_ON_LOAD from "false" to "true". After loading your save, save again. Then exit and change it back to "false". If you have non-unique companions you can reload multiple times until you get something you're happy with. You can see their personalities and backstory printed in the console after a reply, or just run the TALKER proxy with detailed logging.


## NOTES
I wanted a more fun, immersive experience for myself by trying to coax more distinctive and specific responses out of the AI by giving it more material to work with. Your mileage may vary. This expansion has not been tested at-length. I expect a lot of the backstories will need revision. Some backstories might be too prescriptive, leading to repetitive or monotone interactions if the NPC is your companion. More testing is needed.

Different LLMs will provide different output. This was tested on Google's Gemini-2.5-Flash and Nvidia's Kimi-K2-Instruct.

Gemini produces good and seemingly desired results. It takes instruction well, adheres to the rules and seems to understand how to use backstories to inform character behaviour. It can use the information of backstories while understanding it doesn't have to inlcude references to it in every single reply.

Kimi-K2 produces better dialogue but is worse at adhering to instructions. The messages tend to be too long, and it insists on narrating or ``*emoting*`` what the character is doing despite being told not to. It also seems to have a hard time not referring to backstory elements in every reply.
